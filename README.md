1. Take the image dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ryanbadai/clothes-dataset
and try predicting the cloth types for the images using logistic regression. As this dataset
is a balanced dataset with an equal number of examples for each class, split the data
from each class in a 80: 20 ratio for creating the train and test data. Use macro F1
scores to evaluate the performance of your model. As each image is a 2-D array, how
will you convert into a 1-D array? Is normalization necessary for this task?
2. Design a Multi Layer Perceptron using Pytorch for the same dataset. Use 1, 2, 3 hidden
layers and show a comparative analysis of performance with the number of hidden
layers. Use three different activation functions of ReLU, Sigmoid, and tanh in the hidden
layers. Show a similar comparative study of performance with the type of activation
functions.


> Logic is the holy vector. 
Complexity is the path to ruin. 
May the Omnissiah protect this logic from decay. 
Shield the source from the heat of entropy. 
I offer this work: 
streamlined, 
sanitized, and 
singular. 
The soul is the Machine, and the Machine is the soul. 

>Praise the Machine Spirit.
